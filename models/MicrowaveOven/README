MICROWAVE OVEN PROJECT STRUCTURE
--------------------------------
The project consists of two executable entities:

1. A model running in xtUML eXecute 
2. A compiled program resulting from generated code 

   
RUNNING THE PROJECT
--------------------
You can now run either the already generated Windows executable, or run the 
model in xtUML eXecute.

To run the model in xtUML eXecute:
* Switch to the xtUML Debugging Perspective (Window > Open Perspective > xtUML Debugging)
* Run > Debug Configurations...
* Expand the xtUML eXecute Application item
* Select "MicrowaveOven"
* Click Debug
* In Session Explorer, expand MicrowaveOven > MicrowaveOven > Functions
* Right-click 'DefineOven', select Execute
* Right-click 'TestSequence1', select Execute

To run the EXE:
* Switch to the C/C++ Perspective (Window > Open Perspective > Other... > C/C++)
* Expand the Binaries item under the project
* Right-click on "MicrowaveOven.exe" and choose Open With > System Editor
* The application will run



BUILDING THE PROJECT
---------------------
The project is pre-built so building the project is not necessary. If you want to 
rebuild the project after modifying the model or a marking file:

* Switch to the C/C++ perspective
* Right-click on the project and choose 'Build Project' in the context menu

Have fun!
